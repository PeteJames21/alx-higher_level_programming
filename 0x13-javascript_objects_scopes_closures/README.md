## 1-rectangle.js
Write a class Rectangle that defines a rectangle:
- You must use the class notation for defining your class
- The constructor must take 2 arguments `w` and `h`
- Initialize the instance attribute width with the value of `w`
- Initialize the instance attribute height with the value of `h`

## 2-rectangle.js
Write a class Rectangle that defines a rectangle:
- You must use the class notation for defining your class
- The constructor must take 2 arguments w and h
- Initialize the instance attribute width with the value of w
- Initialize the instance attribute height with the value of h
- If w or h is equal to 0 or not a positive integer, create an empty object

## 3-rectangle.js
Augment 2-rectangle.js by adding a method for printing the rectangle.

## 4-rectangle.js
Agument 3-rectangle.js by:
- Creating an instance method called rotate() that exchanges the width and the height of the rectangle
- Creating an instance method called double() that multiples the width and the height of the rectangle by 2

## 5-square.js
Write a class `Square` that defines a square and inherits from `Rectangle` of `4-rectangle.js`

## 6-square.js
Extend 5-square.js by:
creating an instance method called charPrint(c) that prints the rectangle using the character c
- If c is undefined, use the character X

## 7-occurrences.js
